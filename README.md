# No Turning Back (Computer Science Final Project)

## Objective

"No Turning Back" is a maze-like puzzle game that requires the player to reach the opposite end of the maze by collecting keys to unlock gates.
The catch is that the player leaves behind a trail that the player cannot go through themselves.
This means that the player must traverse on a specific path throughout the whole level that allows them to complete the level without ever going through the same path

## Gameplay
The gameplay is quite simple. 
You use the "wasd" keys to move around.
W is to move one block up.
A is to move one block left.
S is to move one block down.
D is to move one block right.
There is also the K button which allows you to reset the level if you get trapped.

The player must collect keys that open a gate of a similar colour.
There is also a teleporter system (or multiple) that the player can use to reach another part of a level without crossing their own path.

## Scoring
The player has two levels to beat. 
The first level is a simple level that gives you a basic layout with multiple ways to beat it. 
Only two gates and one teleporter.

The second level is much harder as it is much larger and has only one path that guarantees victory.
The player must now deal with 4 gates and 4 teleporters.

When the player beats the level they recieve a screen that congratulates them.

## Miscellaneous
Here are the concept arts for the two levels
